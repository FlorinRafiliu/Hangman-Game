# Hangman-Game

  - Application written for a project from highschool;
  - Programming language: C# (.NET);
  - It is a implementation of the well known game [Hangman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game))
  - I implemented a login/register account system using a MySql database;
  - To play just download the folder and run "Atestat_2023.exe" from "Hangman\Atestat_2023\bin\Debug\";
  - For adding new words you need to connect in "admin" mode using **admin** for username and **admin123** for password.

  Some of the skills I developed while working on this applications are:
1. Programming in C# and working with the .NET framework;
2. Working with SqlServer from C#;
3. Managing database connections;
4. Implementing a ranking system (Hall of Fame) based on player score;
5. Validating user inputs (e.g., username, password);
6. Dynamically updating the UI based on user actions
